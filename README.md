chatbot using NLP,SQL
To build a chatbot using Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and SQL, the idea is to process user input (queries) in natural language, extract the essential information, and retrieve the appropriate responses from a database. Here’s an explanation of the role of NLP and SQL in this chatbot:

Role of NLP:
Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. In this chatbot, the NLP techniques are responsible for:

Tokenization: Breaking down the user’s input into smaller units like words or phrases. For instance, the query “Find me all students from the Computer Science department” would be broken into individual words.

Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. This helps in handling different word variations. For example, “students” becomes “student,” and “finding” becomes “find.”

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying key entities (like names, places, dates) from the text. In a chatbot scenario, this might involve identifying a department name, student name, or subject in the user query.

Intent Recognition: Understanding the purpose of the query, such as retrieving information or performing a database action. This is crucial for the chatbot to understand what the user wants to do, such as fetching data, updating, or inserting data into a database.

Stopword Removal: Removing common words like "is," "the," "and" that don’t contribute significantly to the intent of the query.

NLP allows the chatbot to convert human language into structured commands that are understandable by the SQL database.

Role of SQL:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with the database where the chatbot's knowledge or data is stored. After NLP processes the user query, the chatbot generates the appropriate SQL queries to fetch, insert, or update data in the database. For example:

Retrieve Information: If the user asks for student details, the chatbot generates a SQL query like SELECT * FROM students WHERE department = 'Computer Science'.
Insert Information: If the user provides new data, the chatbot might create an INSERT query.
Update/Delete Information: The chatbot can also handle updating or deleting records based on user input.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fe21ab3-e68f-421c-99be-8578e4ea8c69)
